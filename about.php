            Malaysian Association of Aesthetic Dentistry was set up in 2016 by a group of individuals consisting of dentists, dental hygienist/therapists, training providers, insurance providers and business consultants who felt that it was time to organise a professional association to represent the interests of Dentists and Dental Hygienists/Therapists in their non-surgical profession.

                    <p>
                        Dear Colleagues,<br><br>

                        Greeting from the Malaysian Association of Aesthetic Dentistry (MAAD)! I am truly honoured and humbled to be elected as the President for the term 2020 - 2022.<br><br>

                        The landscape of aesthetic dentistry has changed drastically in the last 5-10 years. Rapid onset of digital dentistry, improvements in adhesive dentistry, and the
                        advocacy of minimally invasive dentistry all pose new challenges to the existing and rising aesthetic dentists in Malaysia. Therefore, the MAAD has been at the
                        forefront of bringing new technology and events to address all these changes. In addition, the association has become a platform to learn, to discuss, to collaborate,
                        and to stay connected.<br><br>

                        Smile aesthetics is the leading primary concern of the majority of patients seeking dental treatment. Therefore, changing one’s smile is heavily relying on the
                        knowledge and skills of dental practitioners that may bring out different levels of smile aesthetics. A good aesthetic dentist will be able to build an ideal
                        smile design during the treatment planning and improve the patients’ smile aesthetics, subsequently avoid a treatment outcome that falls short of patient
                        personalization and unachievable ideals. At MAAD, our team strongly believe and advocate that continual learning and education at the highest level is the key
                        to the improvement of standards of aesthetic dentistry. We will strive to continue on our mission to promote excellence in aesthetic dentistry, to set a better
                        standard for aesthetic dentistry in Malaysia by the modernization of our professional services in line with technology amplification for present
                        and future generations in Malaysia.<br><br>

                        We will continue to develop the roles of the council members to serve our members even better in the coming years.<br><br>

                        I look forward to meeting all our members at the upcoming events. We will keep you all posted through our website and our social media pages.
